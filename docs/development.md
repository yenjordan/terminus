# Development Guide

This guide provides instructions and best practices for developing within the FastAPI React Starter project.

## 1. Project Structure Overview

The project is organized into a `backend` (FastAPI) and a `frontend` (React) directory, along with a `docs` directory for this documentation and root-level configuration files.

*   **`backend/`**: Contains the FastAPI application.
    *   `app/`: Core application code (main app, config, db, routes, schemas, services, utils).
    *   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
    *   `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and tool configuration (e.g., Black).
    *   `manage.py`: Script for database migrations and other management commands.
*   **`frontend/`**: Contains the React application.
    *   `src/`: Core application code (components, features, hooks, layouts, etc.).
    *   `package.json`: Node.js dependencies and scripts.
    *   `vite.config.ts`: Vite build configuration.
    *   `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   **`docs/`**: Project documentation (MkDocs).
*   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the services for Docker.
*   **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configuration for pre-commit hooks.

For a more detailed visual structure, refer to the `README.md` or the [Project Overview](index.md).

## 2. Backend Development (FastAPI)

### Key Directories

*   **`app/main.py`**: FastAPI application entry point.
*   **`app/config/config.py`**: Environment settings and logging configuration.
*   **`app/db/`**: Database connection (`database.py`) and SQLAlchemy models (`models.py`).
*   **`app/routes/`**: API endpoint definitions.
*   **`app/schemas/`**: Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
*   **`app/services/`**: Business logic and service layer.
*   **`app/utils/`**: Utility functions (e.g., custom logger setup, though primary logging is in `config.py`).

### Linting and Formatting

*   **Black**: Code formatting is enforced using Black. Configuration is in `pyproject.toml` (`line-length = 100`).
    *   It's recommended to integrate Black into your IDE or run it manually before committing:
        ```bash
        # Navigate to backend directory
        cd backend
        black .
        ```
*   **Pre-commit Hooks**: Black is also run as a pre-commit hook (see section below).
*   **(Optional) Ruff/Flake8/MyPy**: Consider adding Ruff (for linting and formatting, can replace Black/Flake8) or MyPy (for static type checking) for enhanced code quality. Add them to `requirements-dev.txt` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Running Tests

This backend is setup with pytest and coverage. To run tests, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
pytest --cov=app
```

### Database Migrations

The project uses Alembic for database migrations, managed via `manage.py`.

*   **Generate a new migration (after changing models):**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the backend directory
    cd backend
    python manage.py makemigrations "Your descriptive migration message"
    ```
*   **Apply migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
*   **Check migration status:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py db-status
    ```
*   **Downgrade (revert) last migration:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py downgrade
    ```
*   **Reset database (development only - drops all tables and reapplies all migrations):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py reset_db
    ```

### Logging

Structured logging is configured in `backend/app/config/config.py`. The main application logger can be imported and used as follows:

```python
from app.config import logger

logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
```

### Adding New Features

1.  **Models (`app/db/models.py`):** Define or update SQLAlchemy models.
2.  **Schemas (`app/schemas/`):** Create Pydantic schemas for request/response validation and serialization.
3.  **Services (`app/services/`):** Implement the business logic.
4.  **Routes (`app/routes/`):** Define new API endpoints, using the services and schemas.
5.  **Migrations:** Generate and apply database migrations if models changed.
6.  **Tests:** Write tests for the new functionality.

## 3. Frontend Development (React)

### Key Directories

*   **`src/App.tsx`**: Main React application component and router setup.
*   **`src/components/`**: Reusable UI components.
    *   `ui/`: shadcn/ui components.
*   **`src/features/`**: Feature-specific modules (e.g., auth, health).
*   **`src/hooks/`**: Custom React hooks.
*   **`src/layouts/`**: Page layout components.
*   **`src/lib/`**: Utility functions and configurations (e.g., `utils.ts` for shadcn).
*   **`src/routes/`**: Page components rendered by React Router.
*   **`src/types/`**: TypeScript type definitions.

### Linting, Formatting, and Type Checking

*   **Prettier**: Code formatting is enforced using Prettier. It's configured to run via pre-commit hooks.
    *   To format manually:
        ```bash
        # Navigate to frontend directory
        cd frontend
        npm run format
        ```
    *   To check formatting:
        ```bash
        npm run format:check
        ```
*   **ESLint**: (Consider adding ESLint for code quality and style rules if not already implicitly handled by Prettier/TypeScript setup).
*   **TypeScript**: Static type checking is performed by TypeScript.
    *   To type-check the project:
        ```bash
        # Navigate to frontend directory
        cd frontend
        npm run typecheck
        ```

### Running Tests

*(Documentation on the testing framework (e.g., Vitest, React Testing Library) and how to run tests should be added here. This will be updated as tests for the frontend are added in the future.)*

### Styling

*   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling. Configuration is in `frontend/tailwind.config.js`.
*   **shadcn/ui**: Collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Components are typically added via the shadcn/ui CLI and can be found in `src/components/ui/`.

### Adding New Features/Components

1.  **Define Types (`src/types/`):** If new data structures are involved.
2.  **Create Components (`src/components/` or `src/features/`):** Develop new React components.
3.  **Implement Hooks (`src/hooks/`):** For reusable logic or data fetching.
4.  **Add Routes (`src/App.tsx` or `src/routes/`):** If new pages are needed.
5.  **Style:** Use Tailwind CSS classes and shadcn/ui components.
6.  **Tests:** Write tests for new components and logic.

## 4. Working with Docker (Development)

While developing, you might need to interact with the Docker containers:

*   **View logs for all services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```
*   **View logs for a specific service (e.g., backend):**
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f backend
    ```
*   **Access a shell in a running container (e.g., backend):**
    ```bash
    docker compose exec backend /bin/bash
    ```
*   **Rebuild and restart a specific service (e.g., backend after changing dependencies):**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d backend
    ```
*   **Stop all services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

## 5. Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks managed by `pre-commit` to automatically lint and format code before committing. The configuration is in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

**Hooks include:**
*   `trailing-whitespace`: Removes trailing whitespace.
*   `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with a single newline.
*   `check-yaml`: Checks YAML files for syntax errors.
*   `check-added-large-files`: Prevents committing large files.
*   `black`: Formats Python code.
*   `prettier`: Formats frontend code (JS, TS, JSON, CSS, Markdown).

**Setup:**
If you haven't already, install `pre-commit` and set up the hooks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed, e.g., via pip or brew)
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts from the project root
pre-commit install
```
Now, the hooks will run automatically on `git commit`.

## 6. Debugging Tips

*   **Backend (FastAPI):**
    *   Use `print()` statements or the configured `logger`.
    *   FastAPI's interactive debugger (if an error occurs in development mode).
    *   Set breakpoints if using an IDE with debugging capabilities (e.g., VS Code).
    *   Check `docker compose logs backend` for errors if running via Docker.
*   **Frontend (React):**
    *   Use browser developer tools (console, network tab, React DevTools extension).
    *   `console.log()` statements.
    *   React DevTools for inspecting component hierarchy, state, and props.
    *   Check `docker compose logs frontend` for build errors if running via Docker.
